# Random-Track-Generator-Neural-Net
Investigation into neural networks - 
Car driving around a randomly generated track

The aim of my project is to make a car go around a randomly generated track using a Neural network. 
Very simply, Neural networks are designed to model the human brain. They take in input data, process it, and output answer which they then compare to the correct answer and tweak how they process the data accordingly, in order to get closer to the correct answer. They’re very good at spotting and adapting to patterns which makes them commonly used in problems like “the traveling salesman problem” or in spam detection filters or stock market predictors. My aim is to get a neural network to learn to drive a car without crashing into the walls.
